# DefenderForCloudQueries
KQL Queries for Defender for Cloud.

These KQL queries may help to gather information from Defender for Cloud, such as security recommendations and security scores. These may come handy when you have many subscriptions and large clouds where UI in the Defender for cloud may not be the optimal solution. Yes, you can get CVS files downloaded straight up, but they lack for example subscription names and filtering with for example tags.
